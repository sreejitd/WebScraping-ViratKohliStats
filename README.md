# WebScraping-ViratKohliStats
This is a basic web scraping program to scrape Virat Kohli's Date-wise stats from stats.cricinfo
It is very crude right now and does not account for the total number of rows on statsguru yet. If you wish you may add that. 
This can be used as a guide point for analysis, however, it only scrapes dates and runs scored so far.
Things to note:
1. This is last updated for Virat Kohli's game on 28th Jan 2019.
2. The Runs and Dates columns and their sizes need to be updated as per the games played after 28th Jan 2019.
   For Eg: If he has played 5 games after 28th Jan 2019, you need to add 5 to the places marked with 'ADD HERE'. 
   Current: dates=[None]*235, after 5 games change it to 240 and so on.
   
There was a problem scraping cricinfo. I will be updating the add issue later.
